# Oasis Infobyte Internship Task Completion

Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP) repository! Here you will find a collection of my completed tasks during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. 


## Task 2: Number Guessing Game
### Description
The NGGame project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game allows the user to choose a range within which a random number will be generated. The user then has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The game keeps track of the user's score based on the number of correct guesses.

### Features
- Interactive menu with options to play the game, view the scoreboard, or exit
- User can specify the range of numbers for the game
- Limited number of attempts per game
- Scoreboard to track the highest score achieved

### How to Run
To run the NGGame project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Compile the NGGame.java file: `javac NGGame.java`
5. Run the compiled program: `java NGGame`
   
The game will start, and you can follow the on-screen instructions to play, view the scoreboard, or exit.

## Task 3: ATM Interface 
### Description
The ATMApplication project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system implemented in Java. It allows users to perform various banking transactions such as withdrawing, depositing, transferring funds, and viewing their transaction history.

### Features
- User authentication with a user ID and PIN
- Maximum attempt limit for authentication
- Withdrawal and deposit limits
- Transaction history tracking
- Menu-driven interface for transaction selection

### How to Run
To run the ATMApplication project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Compile the ATMApplication.java file: `javac ATMApplication.java`
5. Run the compiled program: `java ATMApplication`

The ATM application will start, and you can follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate and perform various banking transactions.

**Note**: The project includes sample user credentials for demonstration purposes. You can modify the userCredentials map in the ATMApplication class to add or change user credentials as needed.

Thank you for exploring my Repository!.I hope you enjoy reviewing my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!
